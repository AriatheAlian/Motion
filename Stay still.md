I can't do anything. Just sit still, feel exausted, doubt everything. But truth is I even can't produce a word in my mind. 

Blank

I was frozed.

I turned on music, let voice fill my brain. All i can do is dipit this boring moment.

Write your blog.

Nice advice. I'll do that.

They killed me. They already killed me.

What should I write down, about what? My agony? My undiscribable feeling stretching my heart?

Fullfill me. I beg to nobody. I hold a horrible empaty.

My void body. 

They destroyed a pure spirit. from other land they never know. No one ever heard about me, they show no mercy to me just because i speak differient language. Just because im alian....no, they told me, the word should be: ALIEN.

I miss my mom, miss my country, my planet, i dont have to say anything or giva a taken to insinuate anybody. We both know language is nothing, signifer is nothing, we communicate in REAL, we don't have to guess the sign, the amazing fabulous remarkable "essence" just stay here, she will not hide me, never escape.

But in this planet, I had never felt myself. I feared and resistible and unspeakable fear in my language, and this pain will never be alleviate. The language repelled me exiled me, it does not welcome me. It hates me. It explores me and eliminates me.

my "existence" was cannibalized, by language.

I never fit.
